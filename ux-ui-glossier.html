          <b>About the project:</b> <i>Created for a UX/UI design class</i>, the intent of this project
          was to create a new product for an existing brand through
          human-centered design.
          <a href="https://www.glossier.com/">Glossier</a> is a skincare and
          beauty brand that has become a major competitor in the makeup industry
          overnight. Starting from a beauty blog <a href="https://intothegloss.com/">(Into The Gloss)</a>, the brand
          promotes enhancing natural beauty with simple, affordable, easy-to-use
          makeup.

        <h3>The problem.</h3>
        <p>
          My partner and I, while both avid users and fans of the Glossier
          brand, noticed that the process of buying makeup was difficult, with
          many user pain points.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Accessibility</b> — Despite its popularity, the brand is somewhat
            inaccessible to many of its fans, as it only has two permanent
            locations (Los Angeles and New York City). The brand’s website is
            how the majority of their customers purchase their product, however
            this is a problem for first-time users who want to try the product
            before buying. Also, the two permanent locations are in rich areas,
            making the affordable brand rather inaccessible for lower income
            users.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Lack of diversity</b> — A large portion of Glossier’s fan base
            are young, middle-class, white girls. While the brand does a lot for
            inclusivity with its wider range of skin tones,products and models,
            older and lower-income demographics are not as prominent in their
            marketing. Additionally, by putting their stores in high-end
            locations, the store is really only attracting a certain
            <i>type</i> of person.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Purchase process</b> — In-store wait times often ran really long,
            as users had to flag down Glossier employees to start the purchase
            process on an iPad, then wait for their products to be packaged for
            them. When shopping online, customers have to pay for shipping and
            wait 2-3 weeks for their product. The stores are notoriously small,
            crowded, and confusing.

        <h3>My role.</h3>
        <p>
          My partner and I worked together to conduct user research interviews
          with a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds and ages to really
          get an idea of where Glossier falls short. From there, we developed
          beginning user flows and low fidelity wireframes for the vending
          machine experience. We then tweaked the flows and frames to high
          fidelity, created Instagram stories for each location the vending
          machine would be at, designed custom stickers, and even created a
          cardboard prototype.

      <div class="container">
        <h3>The solution.</h3>
        <p>
          <b>For our solution</b>, we decided to create a
          <b>Glossier vending machine</b> that would dispense Glossier products
          in more diverse neighborhoods, gamify the shopping experience, and
          create a memorable and interactive experience for Glossier users. The
          vending machine would “pop up” in eight different locations (Honolulu,
          San Diego, Venice, San Francisco, Portland, Spokane, Seattle, and
          Vancouver) with the opportunity to expand across the country. We felt
          that these locations would be accessible to both locals and tourists.
          The vending machine would:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Broaden</b> the brand’s reach to a
            <b>more diverse audience</b> of varying socioecnomic and age
            backgrounds
          </li>
          <li>Increase and improve the brand’s <b>accessibility</b></li>
          <li>
            Gamify the shopping experience and make something the Glossier
            <b>community can be excited about</b>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <b>Using an iPad</b> mounted on the vending machine, users would
          select which products they would like to purchase and complete the
          purchase flow with a card reader. Makeup would be packaged into
          Glossier’s signature millennial pink bag and dispensed immediately,
          cutting wait times drastically.
        </p>
      </div>

          src="img/UX_UI_Design/Glossier/Glossier_Screens_3.jpg"
          alt="Glossier iPad screens"
        />
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>The vending machine.</h3>
        <p>
          We wanted to keep the design of the vending machine on-brand with
          Glossier: simple, minimal, and feminine. Therefore, we opted to have
          the purchase process solely on an iPad mounted on the machine. The
          rest of the machine would be Glossier’s signature millennial pink in
          enamel lacquer with a glass top that would showcase the best selling
          products.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users would find the exact location of the vending machine in each
          city by looking at Glossier’s Instagram story. The story and the
          machine would only be available for 24 hours at a specific location
          within each city, gamifying the process. At each location, users will
          be able to collect custom stickers related to the city itself.
