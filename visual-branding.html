        <h3>Overview.</h3>
        <p>
          This was a simple 1 day challenge for myself, to create the branding
          of a product from start to finish. I chose kombucha because I am an
          avid kombucha drinker, but have never really loved the design of the
          different brands.

        <h3>The branding.</h3>
        <p>
          The name came from a joke between a friend and myself, as she often
          called kombucha “kombooty,” because of its great benefits for your
          gut. This then led me to come up with the tagline
          <b>“Good for your gut, good for your butt!”</b> I continued playing
          with this "booty" theme by naming the flavor
          <b>"Booty and the Beet,"</b> a ginger, beet, and oolong tea blend. I
          created two logo lockups, a horizontal one and a more square one.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the logo, I wanted to play with typography and give it a young,
          modern feel. I chose a slim sans-serif typeface and altered it
          slightly, rounding edges and expanding letterforms to give it a
          playful vibe. I chose to use simple vector illustration showcasing the
          “booty” of Kombooty with a seated female figure to further play with
          the joke.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted the overall look to have an abstract, Matisse-inspired, cut
          and paste feel, so I included abstract shapes and rows of dots with
          the simple silhouette.
