        <h3>Overview.</h3>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> September 2018 - May 2019</p>
        <p><b>Tools + skills:</b> Figma, user research interviews, wireframing, prototyping, playtesting, and UI design</p>
        <p><b>About the organization:</b> <i>Diabeat It!</i> is an educational mobile app that uses short
          animated videos, interactive games and levels, and quizzes to teach
          and inform about Type II Diabetes. Each level explains a different
          aspect of Type II Diabetes. This project was created as a senior
          thesis project at the <b>University of Southern California</b>’s
          <b>School of Cinematic Arts</b> in conjunction with a group of doctors
          at the <b>Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles</b> and the
          <b>USC Michelson Center’s Bridge Institute</b>.

        <h3>My role.</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, I was the lead UI designer designing the look and
          feel of the app, illustrations, and all of the screens. I was working
          in a small team of four—a developer, a designer/developer (whose
          thesis project this was), and a Diabetes student researcher—alongside
          doctors at the CHLA to create this app from start to finish. I worked
          to create questions for user interviews, prototypes for playtesting,
          starter copy for the app and informational videos, and finalized
          pixel-perfect screens and assets.

        <h3>The problem.</h3>
        <p>
          Diabetes education for children is more often than not a long
          Powerpoint presentation filled with difficult-to-understand medical
          terms and does not make a large impact with its audience. Most Los
          Angeles patients with Type II Diabetes were of lower income
          communities and had lower education levels. We aimed to make Diabetes
          education:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Understandable</b> — We wanted to break down how Type II Diabetes
            works, how insulin works in diabetic patients, and how healthy
            lifestyle choices can positively affect people with Type II
            Diabetes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Engaging</b> — We did <b>not</b> want this to be just another
            Powerpoint! We wanted the app to be fun, informative, and gamified,
            so that patients could continue using and learning from the app.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Mature...ish</b> — While most patients were 13-18, most had 4th
            to 6th grade reading levels, according to doctors at the Children’s
            Hospital of Los Angeles. We wanted the app to be understandable for
            someone who read at those levels, but also not be too childish or
            condescedning. Toeing the line between friendly and clear, and
            juvenile and patronizing, was a delicate process.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>The solution.</h3>
        <p>
          For the app, we took a three-pronged approach to educate patients on
          Type II Diabetes:
        </p>
        <ul class="bulleted_list">
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Short informational videos</b> — We wanted to make the
            information more digestible by creating short animated videos that
            use metaphors to explain the scientific processes. For example, when
            explaining insulin and its relationship to food consumption, we used
            a metaphor of a lock and a key. Each cell has a specific lock and
            insulin acts as a key to the cell, opening it up for glucose to
            enter. We kept the videos to a maximum of 1:30 to account for short
            attention spans.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Questions to reinforce</b> — To test the retention of knowledge,
            we added short questions quizzing users after each short video. The
            questions would be multiple choice and directly address key points
            learned in the prevous informational video.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Interactive games</b> — At the end of each level users can play a
            short, interactive game that would further reinforce the concepts
            taught at that level. This is a fun and interactive way to re-learn
            topics and really get a good understanding of them.

        <h3>The design direction.</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted the look and feel of the app to be friendly, inviting,
          modern, and medicine-related. One of the biggest challenges when
          designing this app was creating a UI that was both simple and
          friendly, but not too childlike. We didn’t want our teenage users, who
          primarily read at 4th grade reading levels, to feel as if we were
          treating them like children. So we looked to <b>Headspace</b> for
          inspiration, as they bridge the gap between goofy and grown-up with
          their friendly monster characters and modern color scheme.
        </p>
        <p>I still wanted the app to feel “scientific” and “medical” despite looking friendly, so I designed opaque cell structures as backgrounds and headers for each screen. I also created avatars that were parts of the cell (golgi apparatus, mitochondria, ribosome, and a vesicle) in a similar “cute” style to Headspace. Users would choose one of the four avatars when setting up the app.</p>
        <p>For the colors, I wanted them to be harmonious and bright, but still modern and serious, so I opted for various shades of aqua, salmon, and yellow. Each color has 3 different shades for differentiation throughout the app.</p>
