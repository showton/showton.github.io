        <h2 class="post-header">PROJECT INTENT</h2>
        <p class="post-width">Waiting Room is meant to be played in the actual waiting room of a college health center.
            Divided
            into three separate themes--Everyday Health, Mental Health, and Women's Health--the game focuses on the
            challenge to
            receive good healthcare as a college student. The design of the game itself is on a three sided brochure
            with the rules
            on one third, punch-out scenario and move cards on the second, and the board itself on the third. Students
            can play
            discreetly and pass it on to other students easily with this design. </p>

        <p class="post-width">This mockup focuses on the issue of women's health at the Engemmann Student Health Center,
            specifically
            the issues of obtaining birth control, getting treatment for a urinary tract infection, and sexual
            assault.</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">THE BOARD</h2>
        <p class="post-width">The structure of the game is similar to Clue and Chutes and Ladders. Each player gets a
            scenario card
            describing their ailment. Players play the nose game to determine who starts (which mimics the randomness of
            receiving
            treatment at the health center). Players take turns drawing move cards which give players either advantages
            or
            disadvantages. This mockup works with the Women's Health theme.</p>
