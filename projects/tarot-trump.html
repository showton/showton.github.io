    <p class="post-description">for this project, we were given Funko Pop toy boxes of three presidential candidates
        (Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders) to redesign with the intent of creating an argument through
        graphic
        design</p>

        <p class="post-width">My partner and I chose to play with the idea of mysticism and fortune telling for this
            redesign
            project, emphasizing why Trump would be unfit as President, according to us, using the tarot cards of the
            emperor, the
            hierophant (high priest), the lovers, and the fool to represent his imperial, dogmatic, narcissistic, and
            foolish traits. My partner did the main panel (The Emperor), while I did the other three.</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">MOODBOARD</h2>
        <p class="post-width">we chose to stick with colors that were similar to the colors of the American flag, but
            slightly
            different to emphasize how his presidency will be so unlike others before his. We also chose the color gold
            to
            tie in the theme of tarot cards and fortune with Trump's signature gold color (which ardorns his hotels,
            merchandise,
            and house)</p>
