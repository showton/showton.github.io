      <h2 class="post-header">Part I: Identifying a Problem</h2>
      <p class="post-width">The intent of this project was to create a new product for an existing brand through human-centered design. My partner
        Teak and I, while both avid users and enormous fans of the Glossier brand, noticed that the process of buying makeup was difficult, with
        many user pain points.</p>
      <p class="post-width">Glossier is a skincare and beauty brand that has become a major competitor in the makeup industry overnight.
        Despite its popularity, the brand is somewhat inaccessible to many of its fans, as it only has two permanent locations
        (Los Angeles and New York City). The brand’s website is how the majority of their customers purchase their product,
        however this is a problem for first-time users who want to try the product before buying.</p>
      <p class="post-width">Our solution is to create a gamified vending machine that is available in 8 major cities across the West Coast:
        Los Angeles (Venice Beach), San Diego, San Francisco, Honolulu, Portland, Seattle, Spokane, and Vancouver.
        Users would find the exact location of the vending machine in each city by looking at Glossier’s Instagram story.
        The story and the machine would only be available for 24 hours at a specific location within each city, gamifying the
        process. At each location, users will be able to collect custom stickers related to the city itself.</p>

      <h2 class="post-header">PROJECT GOALS</h2>
      <p class="post-width">With this product, we want to tackle the problem of inaccessibility and also,
        Glossier’s lack of diversity. By providing more options to purchase the product, users of different socioeconomic
        statuses will be able to both find and purchase the products. We have three distinct goals for this product:
      </p>
      <p class="post-width">
        1. give the existing Glossier community something to be excited about
        <br>
        2. extend the brand’s reach by providing an accessible dispenser for people of all incomes and regions
        in the West Coast
        <br>
        3. create a more interactive experience for brand users

      <h2 class="post-header">USER PERSONAS</h2>
      <p class="post-width">We interviewed three users of diverse ages and socioeconomic backgrounds about their experience
      with Glossier. From these three users, we created the three user personas of Natalie, a 21 year old Latina barista,
      Liza, an 18 year old middle-class millennial, and Diane, a 48 year old mother.</p>

      <p class="post-width">For this project, we decided to go above and beyond by actually designing and building a
      cardboard prototype. </p>

      <h2 class="post-header">CONCLUSIONS + NEXT STEPS</h2>
      <p class="post-width">Continuing the user research, we tested this product with five Glossier brand users who all saw this
      product concept as something they would love to see and use and an effective solution to Glossier’s
      lack of accessibility and diversity because it brings the brand to different areas and different people. My partner and
      I loved working on this project and want to pitch this idea to Glossier! Moving forwards, we would want these
      vending machines to spread across the United States, arrive in more low-income areas, use Glossier customer
      data to better tailor its locations, and potentially partner with ridesharing apps such as Lyft or Uber.</p>
