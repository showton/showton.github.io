        <h3>Overview.</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Tikscore</b> is a TikTok influencer data analysis website that
          connects popular Tiktokkers with well known brands for collaboration,
          sponsorships, and more. The site complies data of the top 50 most
          popular TikTok influencers, popular trends, and popular songs. The
          project already had several well-known brands and influencers signed
          on to use and promote the site.

        <h3>My role.</h3>
        <p>
          As the sole designer for this project, I was tasked with creating a <b>mobile-first</b> design that allowed users to easily sort between the most popular, fastest growing, and newly followed TikTok influencers. Each influencer has a dedicated detail page with data related to their growth on the platform (average likes per post, growth rates, and change over time). I also created two contact forms, one that influencers would fill out to get in touch with brands and grow their own platform and another for brands to become affiliated with Tikscore.

        <h3>The design direction.</h3>
        <p>
          The design needed to be bold, bright, and young to appeal to a primarily generation z audience. I chose bold colors, created bright icons, and stuck with a simple typography palette of Nevis Bold and Avenir Roman.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the colors, I wanted them to be reflective of the collaborative and young nature of TikTok. I chose bright, harmonious colors and named them after some of the most popular TikTok songs: Supalonely, Sunday Best, Savage, Roxanne, and Say So.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used line art icons and filled them in with the color palette to keep a clean look, while also giving it a young and fresh vibe.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the logo, I wanted to find a balance between youth and data analytics, as Tikscore is a TikTok data analytics website. I chose to use a simple black, but added a pop of “Roxanne Lavender” for a splash of color.
