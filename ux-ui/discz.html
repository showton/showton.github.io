          <b>Discz</b> is a music discovery app that leverages the Spotify API
          so that users can swipe new recommended songs based off of their
          Spotify listening habits to add them to their favorite playlists.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>The problem.</h3>
        <p>
          While music consumption has shifted to primarily online streaming,
          many users crave ways to discover new music. However, many online
          platforms make it difficult to explore or discover new music, leading
          to user fatigue. Additionally, most users described recommended
          playlists as “hit or miss,” and wished there were more tailored
          recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary issues we aimed to tackle were:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>User fatigue and overwhelm when finding new music</li>
          <li>Designing an app that is inspirational, but not intrusive</li>
          <li>Creating a sticky, gamified user experience</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="problem_statement">
          <i>
            How might we help users to find new music without impeding a user’s
            music listening journey?</i
          >
        </h4>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>The solution.</h3>
        <p>
          Discz allows users to quickly find new music by swiping through 30
          second snippets of songs. A swipe right adds a song to a playlist,
          while a swipe left discards it. Users can even filter by BPM, key, or
          find songs similar to their favorite artists, playlists, or genres.

        <h3>My role.</h3>
        <p>
          As the primary designer, I worked with both co-founders to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create the mood, tone, and design direction for Discz.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design the logo, submarks, patterns, and textures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design the user experience and user interface of the Discz app to
            bring it to market.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create social media templates for the Discz team to use to promote
            their app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design App Store promotional images to officially publish Discz to
            the App Store.
          </li>
          <li>Design a deck for the Discz team to use while fundraising.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The design direction.</h3>
        <p>
          The Discz team wanted a young, electric feel that would cater to their
          Gen Z audience. For the design direction, I chose purple tones as
          background colors to mimic the hazy, bluish tones of EDM clubs. This
          paired well with bright neon blues and pinks, with a glow of those
          same colors, to create a neon light effect for many of the elements on
          the Discz app.
        </p>
        <p>
          The logo was inspired by the OG CD disc, I wanted to take apart its
          shape and create a logo with a distinctive and recognizable icon. I
          found the separated discs to be recognizable at any size and an homage
          to discs themselves. For the primary logo, I added glows behind each
          of the separated discs to bring more of a neon light to the logo. I
          also added a gradient as a nod to the holographic CD disc glare.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the fonts, we chose a big, chunky primary font that was bold and
          loud (like Gen Z), with a simpler sans serif as a secondary font. I
          also created a “vinyl disc” texture to use to supplement other graphic
          or UI elements.
