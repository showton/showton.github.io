    <h2 class="post-title">UPBEAT MOBILE APP DESIGN</h2>
    <p class="post-description">in this 48 hour hackathon (TrojanHacks 2015 Hackathon), four other teammates and I
        created the app Upbeat,
        a crowd-sourcing music app for parties that won first place. I was responsible for all graphic design and
        branding for
        the app with another teammate</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">APP FUNCTION</h2>
        <p class="post-width">Upbeat is a party app that either lets you find a party or create your own. After joining
            a party, you
            can add songs to the party playlist. Using Spotify Premium's queuing feature, this app uses upvotes or
            downvotes to move
            songs up or down the queue.</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">MAKE YOUR PARTY</h2>
        <p class="post-width">This option allows people to name their party, type in their address (which will be
            viewable for party-goers)
            and to type in an optional password if the party is private.</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">PASSWORD POPUP</h2>
        <p class="post-width">This mockup shows what Upbeat users would see if they tapped the "Find a Party" button and
            chose a party that used a password. Users would have to type in a specific password to be able to see the
            party's playlist.</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">FIND A PARTY</h2>
        <p class="post-width">Upbeat users can find a party by tapping on the "Find a Party" button. Party names
            pop up that users can tap on to view more information, such as the address.</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">CURRENT PARTY</h2>
        <p class="post-width">This mockup shows what the party playlist would look like to Upbeat users. Users can
            either add a song
            to the queue or upvote/downvote songs in the playlist to move them up or down the queue.</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">HOST'S PAGE</h2>
        <p class="post-width">The host's page features album artwork, the song, artist, and album name; the party name,
            pause,
            skip, and play buttons; and a shut down button for when the party ends.</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">SHUTDOWN PAGE</h2>
        <p class="post-width">If a party is shut down, this page will immediately show on every Upbeat user's phone to
            indicate that
            the party is over.</p>

        <h2 class="post-header">LOGO</h2>
        <p class="post-width">The logo features a lowercase "u" to reference the name of the app (Upbeat) and an arrow
            running
            through it to symbolize the up beat.</p>
