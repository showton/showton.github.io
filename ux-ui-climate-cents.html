        <h3>Overview.</h3>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> August 2018 - May 2019</p>

          <b>About the organization:</b> Climate Cents is an environmental
          crowdfunding non-profit organization that informs users of how they
          can get involved in helping protect, heal, and sustain our planet.
          Users can support local environmental volunteer projects or
          non-profits by donating to various vetted campaigns.

        <h3>The problem.</h3>
        <p>
          Most millennial and Gen Z users want to support environmental causes
          and campaigns, but don’t know where to start. This is called
          <b>donor fatigue.</b> When users are overwhelmed by different donation
          requests, the <b>barrier to entry</b> becomes quite large.
          Additionally, Climate Cents’ <b>mission was unclear</b> and had
          various <b>usability issues</b>, as most campaigns were expired or
          with broken links.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was in charge of redesigning the experience to
          <b>gamify the donation process</b>, create a social platform for
          donations, and a <b>cohesive visual design</b> across the various
          different platforms. When beginning the design process, the central
          question we wanted to focus on was:
        </p>
        <h4 id="problem_statement">
          <i>
            How might we empower communities to take action in fighting against
            climate change?</i>
        </h4>

        <h3>My role.</h3>
        <p>
          As the lead designer, I worked with the stakeholders, developers, and
          product managers to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a mobile app donation platform, campaign organizer web
            dashboard, and Climate Cents administrator dashboard that was
            visually cohesive and intuitive
          </li>
          <li>
            Design for all screen sizes and states (logged in, logged out)
            and steps of the donation cycle (from beginning to completion)
          </li>
          <li>Work with developers to QA screens, assets, and pages</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

        <h3>The solution.</h3>
        <ul class="bulleted_list">
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Mobile app</b> — The mobile app would serve as a way to reduce
            the barrier to entry for younger donors. Users could follow
            enviornmental campaigns, donate to them, follow friends and see who
            they donated to, create donation teams, and stay up to date with
            campaign updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Campaign organizer dashboard</b> — The campaign organizer
            dashboard would allow donation campaign organizers to send text,
            image, or video updates, track donations over time, submit new
            campaigns for approval, or delete old campaigns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Climate Cents administrator dashboard</b> — The administrator
            dashboard would function solely for the Climate Cents team as a way
            to approve or deny requests for new campaigns from campaign
            organizers, view campaign statistics, and view campaign updates that
            have been sent to users.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The impact.</h3>
        <p>
          In May, all of my team’s work was packaged and sent to the Climate
          Cents team to be put on the App Store. This project was one of the few
          Code the Change projects that was actually fully completed by the May
          deadline. All assets, designs, and the code stack were delivered to
          the stakeholders to use.
