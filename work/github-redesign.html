      <h2 class="post-header">PROJECT INTENT</h2>
      <p class="post-width">The intent of this project was to create a pragmatic user experience redesign of an existing platform.
        I chose GitHub because as a novice user I felt frustrated at its difficulty in 1. finding your own repository and 2. searching
        for other users on the platform itself. I wanted to redesign Github to be understandable to both the seasoned Github users and the
        complete novices.</p>

      <h2 class="post-header">PROJECT GOALS</h2>
      <p class="post-width">For the final design, I chose to land the user in their own dashboard that highlighted their top repositories and
        had an easy tab navigation to view all of their repositories, their starred repositories/users, their followers, and who they follow. I also
        changed the search bar slightly so that it returns the top most relevant information first (instead of just showing repositories) and a tab navigation bar
        view the different search categories (users, wikis, marketplace, tags, issues, etc.).</p>

      <h2 class="post-header">USER PERSONAS</h2>
      <p class="post-width">From data taken from 3 different user research interviews, I created two different user personas: a novice user and an
        experienced user. Each user found difficulty in navigating the site and frustration at the search function.</p>

      <h2 class="post-header">USER FLOWS</h2>
      <p class="post-width">For this project, I created a user flow of the existing platform, highlighted the steps that could be cut out, the obstacles
        users faced, and what could be edited; and then created revised user flows for the new experience.</p>

      <h2 class="post-header">CONCLUSIONS + NEXT STEPS</h2>
      <p class="post-width">If I were to continue this project, I would continue revising the top navigation as it was also
        confusing, create gifs in the documentation of what each snippet of code should do so that novice users wil know what to
        type into their terminal, and also make it easier for users to explore Github for inspiration.</p>
