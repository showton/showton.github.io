        <h2 class="post-header">BOOKLET COVER</h2>
        <p class="post-width">This booklet's cover is an homage to books and the Abstract Expressionist movement,
            particularly
            Wassily Kandinsky. It plays with the general form of a book, but abstracts the shape and layers different
            shapes
            on top of each other using various opacities.</p>
