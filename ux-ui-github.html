        <h3>Overview.</h3>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> August - October 2018</p>
        <p>
          <b>Tools + skills:</b> Figma, Adobe Photoshop, UX design, user
          research, journey mapping, personas, wireframing, prototyping, UI
          design

        <p>
          <b>About the project:</b> <i>Created for a UX/UI design class</i>, the
          intent of this project was to redesign an existing brand’s user
          experience and interface, finding pain points and addressing them
          through the redesign. Github, despite being a powerful and
          industry-standard tool, has a fairly large barrier to entry for novice
          users. Its design gears it towards only one type of user: a
          programmer. I wanted to <b>reduce this barrier to entry</b> and
          <b>broaden its user base</b> to users of all different levels of
          computer science.

        <h3>The problem.</h3>
        <p>
          As a novice user, I found Github to be extraordinarily difficult to
          use. I found its emphasis on social sharing to be redundant and
          distracting, slowing down the overall experience of finding and
          sharing your code. After conducting user research interviews of three
          varying levels of Github users (novice, developer, and Computer
          Science professor), there were three items I wanted to tackle with
          this redesign.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Search</b> — Github’s search functionality often returned
            inconsistent results. If you were in your own repository, it would
            search that first before searching globally, without properly
            indicating where it was searching to the user.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Finding repositories</b> — I wanted to make the path to a user’s
            repository as simple and seamless as possible. Currently, users land
            on a page that shows who they’re following (and the current activity
            of those users) with repositories on the far left.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Explore functionality</b> — While Github’s “social network”
            attempted to inspire discovery of new repositories, ideas, and code,
            it was more distracting than useful. However, one of the most common
            complaints from users was that there really wasn’t a way to explore
            new code easily.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>My role.</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, I was redesigning the product from start to finish.
          This included conducting various user research interviews,
          journey-mapping, redesigning user flows, and creating low and high
          fidelity wireframes for the improved design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I began by interviewing users of varying levels of experience with
          Github. Elizabeth’s interview stood out in particular, as her main
          frustrations were her inability to find what she was looking for and
          the lack of resources to understand the platform itself.

        <h3>The solution.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Land users in their own dashboard</b> — This cuts out any
            unnecessary or distracting visual noise and gets users directly
            where they need to go: their repositories. The redesigned dashboard
            would highlight their top repositories with an easy tab navigation
            to get to all of their repositories, starred repositories, followed
            users, and users who follow them.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Social on the side</b> — I put the “social media” aspect of
            Github into a navigational “drawer” on the side. This would show
            recent activity from followed users (with the option to show more or
            less) and popular repositories or code on Github. Users would have
            the option to hide the drawer (which would slide the drawer to the
            left), if they didn’t want to see the extra information.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Global search, simplified</b> — While Github does currently
            utilize global search, it is <b>not communicated to its users</b>. In this
            redesign, Github would <b>return the top results of the search query
            first</b>, which would be anything that most closely relates to the
            search itself. A navigational tab bar above would highlight specific
            categories that the search query returned results in. For example,
            it would show 9 repositories that had similar keywords to the search
            query and 1 user. When users click on each tab, the information
            filters to only that category, making search faster.
