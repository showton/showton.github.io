        <h3>The problem.</h3>
        <p>
          This well-known legacy brand was falling short compared to other
          competitors due to its clunky, inconsistent, and outdated user
          experience and user interface. Active buttons were gray, typography
          and colors varied across different products, and the content strategy
          itself created a difficult-to-navigate user experience. The primary
          issues I wanted to tackle were:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Inconsistent components and designs across different products
          </li>
          <li>
            Poor UX and accessibility on the site
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigation across different products and services
          </li>
        </ol>

            How might we elevate both the user experience and the visual design
            of this brand to industry standards, while still retaining its
            unique branding and history?</i

        <p>
          The biggest challenge of this site refresh was
          <b>creating one product</b>
          from 9 different sub-products of this legacy brand. When I first began
          <b> designing a vision</b>, I went as far away from the brand as
          possible, letting my creativity roam free. The primary themes I wanted
          to focus on were:
        </p>
        <ul class="bulleted_list">
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Look and feel</b> — I wanted the site to feel airy, with lots of
            visual breathing room, but evoke energy, friendliness, and
            expertise. This would not only bring the brand up to industry
            standards, but also set it apart from other competitors.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Breaking the grid</b> — A large part of the current site is its
            rigid, formulaic grid system. With this vision, I wanted to visually
            break these conventions, while also still utilizing a grid system.
            This would create visual dynamism and bring the user down the page.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Updated imagery</b> — Imagery, especially stock imagery, can
            often fall into the cheesy, corny category. For this proposal, all
            imagery was realistic, vibrant, and followed specific rules
            (subjects cannot look directly into the camera, images weren’t over
            or under-saturated, etc).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges was actually
          <b>scaling down to something more feasible</b> (both technically and
          with the brand itself). A large part of the final design was
          compromise—with product owners, content writers, and developers. This
          included maintaining a grid and more "formualic"-looking components
          for MVP.

        <h3>My role.</h3>
        <p>
          What began as a simple pitch to a specific team blossomed into a full
          site refresh. The company was undergoing a content management system
          upgrade and <b>needed a design direction for MVP</b>, which is where I
          was able to step in. As the sole UX/UI designer on this team, I worked
          across various products and with product managers, product owners,
          developers, content writers, and marketers to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a <b>mobile-first</b>, comprehensive
            <b>system of interchangeable components</b> to be used site-wide
          </li>
          <li>
            Set <b>consistent color, typography, and UX standards</b> across the
            site
          </li>
          <li>
            Introduce <b>new, future-state ideas</b> for the visual design to
            set the brand apart from competitiors
          </li>
          <li>
            Work closely with developers and content writers to
            <b>spec and QA</b>
            created assets and pages
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <img
          class="full_image"
          src="img/UX_UI_Design/AAA/AAA_Screens_1.jpg"
          alt="The refreshed system"
        />
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>The solution.</h3>
        <p>
          My solution was to create a <b>mobile-friendly design</b> with
          interchangeable components, updated icons, and consistent breakpoints.
        </p>
        <ul class="bulleted_list">
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Icon library</b> — The current site utilized large, filled in
            icons with colored circular backgrounds and drop shadows, all visual
            indicators that the icon is clickable. These icons, however, were
            not clickable but instead static elements used to break up the page
            and add more visual dynamism. <b>For the refresh</b>, I decided to
            transform all the icons into line art, removed the colorful
            backgrounds and drop shadows, and rounded the edges for a cleaner,
            friendlier look that visually communicated “static” to the user. A
            small set of icons were reserved to be specific to each product.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Cards, tiles, pills, accordions, and more</b> — A large part of
            this modular system was the creation of clickable cards that could
            be used across the site and with every product. All products would
            use these components, creating a unified and seamless experience
            across the site. There were 6 variations on the card system (Hero,
            Teaser, Universal, Marketing, Form, and Floating Box) and all
            clickable components (cards, tiles, pills, accordions and modals)
            had a drop shadow indicating user interaction. Static elements, such
            as icon/image rows and blog components, do not have drop shadows and
            use the static, line-art icons.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="bulleted_list">
            <b>Consistent breakpoints</b> — Different products across the site
            had different containers. By creating standardized breakpoints, the
            entire site would have a consistent look, feel, and experience. Each
            screen size from iPhone 5 to large desktop had a consistent set of
            rules until the next breakpoint.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="container">
        <img
          class="full_image"
          src="img/UX_UI_Design/AAA/AAA_Screens_2.jpg"
          alt="The refreshed system"
        />
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h3>Future state ideation.</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the future state ideation included creating dynamic
          illustrations for each product page as a way to move away from
          lifestyle stock imagery (which can be read as corny), while still
          visually highlighting the product. The design direction I led for
          these illustrations was clean, minimal, and friendly, with pops of
          bright color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another future-state proposal I pitched was broadening the brand’s
          colors for web. I wanted the colors to evoke the feeling of the brand,
          not just literally depicting what the brand itself is. Each color tied
          into the history of the brand and was bright, minimal, friendly, and
          helpful. I also created a style guide for Marketing to use with these
          new colors and icons, outlining proper and improper uses (as Marketing
          had previously been given free rein of all assets and colors,
          therefore causing inconsistency in the brand).
